# book-library

CRUD app for a personal book library

This app was created using:
* HTML 
* CSS
* JavaScript.

Data used in this appllication is stored inside a json file and can be accessed using a JSON Server

Run in terminal :
* npm install -g json-server
* json-server books.json

Open `index.html`. To use this app is really simple, I think. When accesing it the user will see a `ADD BOOK` button, few buttons for category and one search bar.
When clicking `ADD BOOK` button a form will be displayed and those form can be completed with information about a book. 
I've should changed the `Description` input field, it's not really a good choice for a field where a user is suppose to insert longer texts.
